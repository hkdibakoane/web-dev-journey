# 🌱 My Self-Taught Web Development Journey

Welcome! This repository is a public record of my learning journey as a self-taught full stack web developer. I started from the very basics of HTML and am working my way toward advanced frontend and backend development topics — posting progress and mini-projects every week.

My goal is to:
- Build a strong foundation in web development
- Stay consistent with biweekly progress posts
- Showcase my growth and technical skills to future employers

## 📅 Weekly Learning Roadmap

Each folder in this repo corresponds to a week of learning and contains:
- 🧠 Code snippets or mini-projects
- 📝 Notes and reflections in `README.md`
- 📸 Screenshots or demo links (when available)

## 📌 Why I'm Doing This
